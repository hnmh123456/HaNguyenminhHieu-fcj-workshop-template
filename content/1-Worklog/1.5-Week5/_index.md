### Week 5 Achievements:

* Deeply understood how cloud systems handle massive traffic via:
  * Layer 7 Load Balancing (ALB)
  * Layer 4 Load Balancing (NLB)
  * ...

* Grasped the importance of automated server health monitoring:
  * Configuring Target Groups
  * Setting up Health Checks

* Manually configured an automated virtual server cloning environment, including:
  * Creating Launch Templates with pre-packaged web server configurations
  * Building Scaling Policies to scale resources based on demand
  * ...

* Fully deployed a High Availability architecture:
  * Running a Load Balancer distributing traffic across multiple Availability Zones
  * Simulating server failure and verifying Auto Scaling's automatic replacement capability
  * ...

* Proven the flexibility and fault-tolerance of a deployed web application.
