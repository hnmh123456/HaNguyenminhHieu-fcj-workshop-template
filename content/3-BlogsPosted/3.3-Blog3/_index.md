# HOW AWS OPTIMIZES AI FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS (CASE STUDY: AIGEN)

An AWS blog post analyzes how Aigen solved the problem of deploying AI in real-world environments for their solar-powered autonomous agricultural weeding robot system. This Edge AI system faced core challenges: unstable Internet connectivity in the field making it difficult to send data to servers, massive image data causing high costs and delays if labeled manually, and highly constrained robot hardware unable to run massive AI models.

Key takeaways on how Aigen optimized with the AWS SageMaker ecosystem:

* The system uses GenAI combined with vision foundation models (like SAM2, Grounding DINO) for automatic segmentation and bounding box drawing (Auto-labeling).
* Active Learning techniques are applied so the system automatically filters out the hardest-to-process images (e.g., unusual lighting angles, obstructed plants) and forwards them for human review.
* Thanks to this automated workflow, image processing time dropped significantly from nearly 15 minutes to a mere 41 seconds/image, while simultaneously cutting labeling costs by up to 22.5 times.
* The model "distillation" process (Model Distillation & Quantization) to solve the weak hardware problem is divided into 4 levels from largest to smallest.
* The levels include: extremely large general Foundation Models running on the cloud (Level 1), Expert & Student Models distilled down for specific tasks (Levels 2, 3), and finally Edge Models (Level 4).
* At Level 4, the model is quantized to the INT8 standard and converted to the TFLite format. The model size at this point is reduced to about 2MB and consumes only 1.5W of power, yet still ensures smooth real-time performance on the robot's onboard circuit.
* The robot maintains a continuous update loop (Closed-loop): uploading raw data to AWS S3 when a network is available -> Auto-labeling -> Retraining the model on powerful Cloud GPU clusters -> Pushing ultra-lightweight updates back to the field so the robot can immediately adapt to new environments.
* Taking AI out of the lab to run smoothly in reality requires a clever combination of the massive computing power of the Cloud and extreme model compression techniques at the Edge device.

*Note: The model goes through 4 levels: from Foundation (ultra-large, running on the Cloud) -> Expert -> Student -> Edge (only 2MB left, consuming 1.5W running on the robot board).*

### 2. Closed-loop data update

*Note: Raw data from the robot is uploaded to S3 -> automatically labeled -> Retraining the model on the Cloud -> pushing the Edge update back to the field.*
