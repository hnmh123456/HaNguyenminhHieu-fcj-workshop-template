#### Goal

In this step, you will wait for AWS to finish associating WAF with your Amplify application and verify the final status.

#### Instructions

1. After clicking `Add firewall`, the system returns to the Firewall management page.
2. The `Web Application Firewall` section may initially show `Associating`.
3. This process usually takes a few minutes while AWS initializes and applies the security rules.
4. Once completed, you can click `View WAF logs` to review allowed and blocked traffic.

#### Expected result

When the process finishes, your application will be protected by AWS WAF and ready for traffic monitoring and control.
